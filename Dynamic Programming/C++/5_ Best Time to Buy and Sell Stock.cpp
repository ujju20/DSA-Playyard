/*Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell

Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0.

Input: prices = [100, 180, 260, 310,40, 535, 695]
Output: 655
Buy on day 5 (price = 40) and sell on day 7 (price = 695), profit =  655.
