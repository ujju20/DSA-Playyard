# Power Of Four

# Given an integer n, return true if it is a power of four. Otherwise, return false.


def PowerOfFour(n):
    '''
     Here n should not be equal to 0 [Example: 16 is not equal to 0]
     Here use  a Bit-wise '&' operator to compare n and n-1 [ n=16[10000] and n-1=15[01111]]
     10000 & 01111 is zero 
     bits donâ€™t '&' any part of the pattern 0xAAAAAAAA [0x10 & 0xAAAAAAAA is zero]
     Hence it will return true
